SteamVR Plugin for OpenHMD Devices

Build:
Run `cmake` and `make` for the OpenHMD base directory. The new OPENHMD_STEAMVR option is enabled by default. This will first build OpenHMD, and then the SteamVR plugin.

Run:
First register the driver with SteamVR:

    ~/.local/share/Steam/SteamApps/common/SteamVR/bin/linux64/vrpathreg adddriver ~/OpenHMD

or

    ~/.local/share/Steam/SteamApps/common/SteamVR/bin/linux64/vrpathreg adddriver ~/OpenHMD/build

if you build in a separate build directory.

The directory given to vrpathreg should contain `driver.vrdrivermanifest` and `bin/linux64/driver_openhmd.so` as a subdirectory.

Then copy the steamvr.vrsettings file that disables the lighthouse and oculus default driver into Steam's config directory.

    cp ~/OpenHMD/steamvr/steamvr.vrsettings ~/.local/share/Steam/config/steamvr.vrsettings

Don't forget to make a backup if you have special SteamVR settings. Now run SteamVR and check ~/.local/share/Steam/logs/vrserver.txt for errors.
